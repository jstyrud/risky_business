        <h2>Investigating Human Drone Interactions</h2>
        <h3><b>The researchers support the practice of protecting research participants' rights. The information in this consent form is provided so that you can decide whether you wish to participate in our study. It is important that you understand that your participation is considered voluntary. This means that even if you agree to participate you are free to withdraw from the experiment within 24 hours after completion of the experiment, without penalty.</b></h3>
        
        <h2>Study Purpose</h2>
        <h3></h3>The purpose of this study is to investigate how drone interactions are perceived by a human drone pilot. This study is being conducted at the Department of Robotics, Perception, and Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology as part of a Master Thesis by Noah Rahimzadagan (under the supervision of Rebecca Stower).
        
        <h2>Participation and Withdrawal</h2>
        Participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to withdraw from this study at any time without prejudice or penalty. If you wish to withdraw, simply stop the task and inform the experimenters. If you do withdraw from the study, the materials that you have completed to that point will be deleted and will not be included in the study. 
        
        <h2>Task</h2>
        Participants will fly a drone with an interface on a tablet. The flying will take place within a confined space. The interaction will consist of the pilot flying the drone to physical checkpoints which result in points given to the participant using the interface. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating each flight with the drone. This study will take a maximum of 1 hour to complete.
        
        <h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>
        There are no foreseeable risks from participating in this study over and above those of everyday living. All participants will have the opportunity to earn up to 100SEK for participating. 
        
        <h2>Confidentiality and security of data</h2>
        Only members of the research team will have access to identified data. All data will be coded in a de-identified manner and subsequently analysed and reported in such a way that responses are not able to be linked to any individual. Data will be used for scientific and non-commercial purposes. 
        
        <h2>Contacts</h2>
        If you have any questions about the study, you can discuss your participation with project staff.
        <br><br>Thank you for your participation!
